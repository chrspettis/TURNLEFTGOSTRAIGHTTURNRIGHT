G) HOW TO USE AI TO HELP YOU

ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot can help even non-coders fix issues or change text.

---

G1) To FIX LINK ERRORS

Prompt:

> I uploaded an HTML game to Canvas. The PLAY button points to a PDF, but students see "Access Denied." Can you help me fix the link?

Paste:
- Your Canvas link
- The broken `<a href="...">` button code

AI will tell you what to change.

---

G2) To EDIT TEXT (SAFE CHANGES)

Prompt:

> I uploaded an HTML file. I want to change the assignment due date from "January 19, 2026" to "February 2, 2026". Can you show me where?

You can also ask:

> Where do I edit the welcome message or sentence examples?

Stick to editing plain text like instructions, titles, and dates.

DO NOT ask AI to “rebuild the game” or “change how the buttons work” unless you’re confident.
